 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the Cipher project up and running on your local machine.

 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

   Python 3.x

 Manual Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Riansuwandi/cipher.git
    cd cipher
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    The core project files are located in the `tugasCipher` directory.

    ```bash
    cd tugasCipher
    ```

3.  Install Python dependencies (if any):
    Currently, this project might not have complex Python dependencies. If there are any, they would typically be listed in a `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Note: If `requirements.txt` does not exist, you can skip this step.)

4.  Open the HTML interface:
    The main user interface is an HTML file. Open it directly in your web browser.

    ```bash
     Example for opening in a browser (might vary by OS)
    open index.html
    ```
    Alternatively, navigate to the `tugasCipher` directory and double-click `index.html`.


 Usage Examples

Once installed, you can interact with the Cipher project through its web interface.

 Basic Encryption/Decryption

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Input your text into the designated text area.
3.  Select your desired cipher algorithm (e.g., Caesar, Vigenere) and mode (Encrypt/Decrypt).
4.  Click the "Process" button to see the result.

```python
 Example of how a Python script might be used in the backend (conceptual)
 This is typically handled by the HTML interface making requests to Python.

 Assuming a Python script named `cipher_logic.py` inside `tugasCipher`
 To run a Python script directly (for development/testing purposes)

 Example: Encrypting text using a hypothetical Caesar cipher function
from cipher_logic import caesar_encrypt

text_to_encrypt = "HELLO"
shift_key = 3
encrypted_text = caesar_encrypt(text_to_encrypt, shift_key)
print(f"Original: {text_to_encrypt}")
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted_text}")
```

 Project Roadmap

The `cipher` project is continuously evolving. Here's a glimpse of what's planned:

   v1.1 - Enhanced Algorithm Support: Introduce support for more advanced cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA).
   v1.2 - User Management: Implement basic user authentication and profile management.
   v2.0 - API Integration: Develop a RESTful API for programmatic access to encryption/decryption functionalities.
   Performance Optimizations Improve the speed and efficiency of existing algorithms.
   Comprehensive Testing: Implement unit and integration tests for all core functionalities.


 Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the `cipher` project! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

 Code Style

   Python: Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines.
   HTML/CSS/JS: Follow standard web development best practices for readability and maintainability.

 Branch Naming Conventions

   Features: Use `feature/your-feature-name` (e.g., `feature/add-vigenere-cipher`).
   Bug Fixes: Use `bugfix/issue-id-short-description` (e.g., `bugfix/123-fix-ui-bug`).
   Hotfixes: Use `hotfix/description` for urgent fixes.

 Pull Request (PR) Process

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch from `main` (or `develop` if applicable) for your changes.
3.  Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages.
4.  Push your branch to your forked repository.
5.  Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the original repository.
6.  Ensure your PR description clearly explains the changes and their purpose.

 Testing Requirements

   Manual Testing: Before submitting a PR, thoroughly test your changes manually to ensure they function as expected.
   Automated Tests (Future): As the project grows, we aim to implement automated tests. Contributions with new tests or improvements to the testing suite are highly encouraged.
